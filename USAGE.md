# How to use QuestionMaker

1. Write your questions as separate markdown files in the `./questions` folder. You can also include images in this folder. See the questions folder for a couple of example questions.

2. Run `questionMaker.exe` (or just `questionMaker` on Linux).

3. Your question generating webpage will be located in './final/index.html'.

4. Open this webpage by double clicking on it. You can also send it to anyone else and they will be
   able to run it - you don't need to send the `questions` folder or anything else along with it!
